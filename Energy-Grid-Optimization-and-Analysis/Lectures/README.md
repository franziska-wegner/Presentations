# Lectures in Energy Grid Optimization and Analysis (EGOA)

A set of lectures that was used in the context of Energy Grid Optimization 
and Analysis (EGOA) to bring the research in energy networks to the students 
in the most visual and understandable way. The slides also show the typical 
research methodology that is used to approach problems.

A teaching overview is given in https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/en/members/franziska_wegner/teaching that has the older slides of the lectures available.
