# Projects in Energy Grid Optimization and Analysis (EGOA)
This folder covers manly presentations that are project dependent. The presentations 
explain and visualize our work to the community in a more coarse grain fashion and 
show the progress over the years within the project. Each major project is listed below 
and the description is given in the link or inline. Note that other project presentations 
are available directly in the main folder.

## 1. Helmholz Program: Storage- and Cross-linked-Infrastructures (SCI)
(Link: https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/en/projects/sci-topic6/index)

The Storage and Cross-linked Infrastructures program is integrated in the Renewable 
Energies Program (EE) and Energy Efficiency, Materials and Resources (EMR) programes 
focussing on energy storage and distribution in current to future power grids. The 
goal is to minimize future power fluctuations caused by energy consumption and 
(renewable) energy generation imbalances. Different energy storage solutions and 
infrastructures are being investigated for this purpose.

The Institute for Theoretical Informatics is involved in one of six topics addressing 
superconductivity, networks and system integrity.

* Research Unit 1 (RU 1) former Topic 6
  * Superconductivity, Networks and System Integration

## 2. Energy Systems Integration (ESI)
(Link: https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/en/projects/esi/index)

* Work Package 1 (WP 1),
* Multimodal Energy System, and 
* Funding: Helmholtz Association, Start date: 2017, End date: 2020.

## 3. Research Training Group "Energy Status Data - Informatics Methods for its Collection, Analysis and Exploitation"
(Link: https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/en/projects/grk2153/index)

The design of future energy systems which can cope with fluctuating supply and 
flexible demand is an important societal concern. An essential aspect is the 
consumption of energy, particularly of complex systems such as factories or IT 
infrastructures. Important points are the flexibilization of energy consumption, 
so that the share of locally generated ‘green’ energy increases, robustness of 
energy provisioning, or the efficient design of new energy systems serving these 
purposes. To accomplish this, a core prerequisite is a structured collection, 
storage and analysis of energy status data. Energy status data describes the 
provisioning of energy, its storage, transmission and consumption, be it the 
outcomes of measurements, be it metadata such as the extent of fatigue of batteries, 
be it other relevant data such as electricity rates. This graduate school targets 
at the handling of such data. To this end, an interdisciplinary approach (computer 
science, engineering, economics, law) is indispensable. It reveals new scientific 
challenges we will confront Ph.D. students with as part of their education. For 
instance, we have observed that different planning and control purposes require data 
of different temporal resolution and at different aggregation levels. This varying 
granularity leads to the question how to find outliers in such data at the right 
level of abstraction. Other graduates benefit from new approaches that detect such 
outliers. They can now work more efficiently, e.g., can identify shortcomings of 
existing models of energy systems systematically. An example of such a model would be 
one describing the behavior of Li-Ion batteries. The infrastructure for energy research 
of the KIT Helmholtz sector such as the EnergyLab 2.0 will be subject/object of our 
graduate school to a significant extent; the persons responsible for these facilities 
are part of the group of applicants of this graduate school. Another distinctive feature 
of the research agenda graduates have to deal with as part of their education with us 
is the comprehensive treatment of the life cycle of energy status data, which consists 
of the phases ‘collection’, ‘analysis’ and ‘deployment’. It yields a significant added 
value, compared to stand-alone Ph.D. work that otherwise would have to cover that entire 
life cycle by itself: For instance, Ph.D. topics falling into an early phase of the life 
cycle might tailor specific methods of collecting energy status data if it is known how 
it will be used. Topics from the phase ‘deployment’ in turn, which want to design better 
energy systems in a data-driven fashion, can work with data of exactly the right quality.
