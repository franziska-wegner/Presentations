# Presentations
This repository provides a set of presentations and lectures in different fields. Most of 
the presentation are developed in IPE that allows LaTeX commands or LaTeX Beamer itself. 
For more information, see the IPE main page (https://ipe.otfried.org) and the IPE manual 
(https://otfried.github.io/ipe/). The idea is to provide a set of files that provide a 
general preamble for IPE slides in algorithms and theoretical computer sciense as well as 
energy networks due to the focus of the origintaors research field. However, this template 
can be implemented and used in various fields.
